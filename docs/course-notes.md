## Module and lesson notes

- Module 05 splits ownership deliberately, to avoid overlap — keep it that way:
  lesson 29 is **TCG internals via user-mode only** (`qemu-aarch64`, `-d in_asm/out_asm/exec`,
  `-one-insn-per-tb`, `-d nochain`); lesson 30 is **the machine model** (memory map, device
  tree, `info mtree -f` / `info qtree` / `info jit`, the 105-byte bare-metal PL011 program);
  lesson 31 is **the command line itself** (four groups of options, the chardev model,
  `-s -S` + `gdb-multiarch` on lesson 30's `hello.elf`); lesson 32 is **a real Linux kernel**
  (prebuilt Debian `Image` + a hand-built initramfs, read the boot log).
- Lesson 32's practice **creates** `~/bai32/` (**135 MB**) holding `Image`,
  `initramfs.cpio.gz` and `run.sh`. **Module 06 is promised these exact files** — U-Boot will
  be made to load them. Once the user has done the practice, do not tell them to delete that
  directory. It does **not** exist yet: the scratch copy built while verifying lesson 32 was
  removed at the user's request on 2026-08-09, so check before assuming the files are there.
- Module 04 runs one thread ending in a self-built toolchain: why cross-compile (25) →
  toolchain anatomy (26) → first ARM64 binary + `qemu-aarch64` (27) → crosstool-NG (28).
  Lesson 27's `temp_daemon.c` (from lesson 24) is recompiled in lesson 28 with musl, so
  **do not** reintroduce that program as new material in module 05.
- Lesson 27 measures the glibc static build **without** `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=4096`
  (**795 224 B**); lesson 28 uses the flag (**787 032 B**). The 8 192 B gap is two 4 KB
  pages and lesson 28 explains it — keep both numbers, they are both correct.
- Lesson 13 ends with a capstone `build.sh` (cross-compiles `hello.c` for x86 or ARM64 using
  `set -euo pipefail` + `mktemp -d` + `trap … EXIT`). Verified numbers reused from Bài 3:
  x86 dynamic **15 952 B**, ARM64 `-static` **705 328 B**, ratio **44.2×**; running the ARM64
  binary directly gives `Exec format error`, exit **126**.
- Module 02 runs one continuous thread: `gcc` → four compilation stages → `make` → `.a`/`.so`
  → ELF internals. It opens (lesson 14 intro) and closes (lesson 18 recap) on the same
  question — why static `hello` is **816 912 B** and dynamic is **15 952 B**, a **51.2×**
  gap — so do not restate that pair as a fresh discovery in module 03.
- Lesson 18 is the reference lesson for `readelf` / `objdump` / `nm` / `size` / `strip`.
  Later modules should point back to it rather than re-teaching the tools: `vmlinux` is
  ELF `EXEC` (Chặng 07), `.ko` is ELF `REL` (Chặng 10).

## Cross-reference map (grep this before writing `Chặng NN` in prose)

Module numbers are the easiest thing to get wrong, because the topic name and the module
number do not resemble each other. Verified against `js/registry.js`:

| Topic named in prose | Correct module |
|---|---|
| cross-compiler, target triplet, musl/uClibc-ng | `Chặng 04` |
| QEMU, booting a kernel image | `Chặng 05` |
| U-Boot | `Chặng 06` |
| building the kernel, Kbuild, `vmlinux`, vDSO | `Chặng 07` |
| Device Tree, `.dtb` | `Chặng 08` |
| rootfs, BusyBox `CONFIG_STATIC`, size-shrinking an image | `Chặng 09` |
| kernel modules, drivers, `.ko` | `Chặng 10` |
| Buildroot, **Yocto**, reproducible builds | `Chặng 11` |
